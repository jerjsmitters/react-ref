      <p>The ISS soars through the exosphere at a mind-boggling 400km in the sky. It perpetually stays at this height by continually falling towards the earth in a controlled manner, such that it never actually collides with it. There is no air resistance this far up in the atmosphere, and so it whizzes by at 5 miles a second; that means it orbits the earth once every 92 minutes!</p>
